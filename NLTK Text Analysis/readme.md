# NLTK Text Analysis

This repository utilizes the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library to perform various text analysis tasks. It showcases different functionalities provided by NLTK, including collocation finding, string manipulations, and data visualization.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the NLTK library using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

# Data Downloads

The following NLTK datasets are downloaded for analysis:

- Gutenberg
- Genesis
- Inaugural
- NPS Chat
- Webtext
- Treebank
- Punkt Tokenizer

# Usage

The code is organized into several tasks demonstrating different text analysis techniques. Below is a brief overview of each task:

## Task 1: Bigram Collocations
This task identifies and prints the top 15 bigram collocations from the text6 and text7 datasets using the likelihood ratio measure.

## Task 2: String Operations
This task demonstrates basic string manipulations by printing and concatenating strings.

## Task 3: Sentence Manipulation
This task shows how to join and split a list of words.

## Task 4: Filtering Words
This task filters and sorts words from text7 that start with the letter 'T'.

## Task 5: Frequency Visualization
This task counts and visualizes the frequency of 4-letter words in text5 using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
